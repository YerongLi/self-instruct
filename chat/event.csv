I received some calls last night from a ‚Äúno-caller ID‚Ä?number. It was a guy with a low voice and he was always breathing very heavily and he kept saying he was coming for me and that he was on his way. I didnt pick up one time and he called again and my roommate talked to him and he knew it wasnt me. It really did not feel like a joke/prank call and my roommate was freaked out too. I was just wondering if theres anything you could do with tracking the call or anything? My roommate left this morning for coachella so I'm alone for [DATE] and I just want to take whatever safety precautions I can because it really didn't feel right.

Needless to say I no longer feel safe around that individual anymore. On a different occasion, the printer was not working in the lab room. I had a paper that was due, and my class was starting in just # minutes. The only two staff members that I could see were across from me, assisting a student with his homework. Myself and another student in a rush to get her paper printed asked for help, yes, interrupting them, but there were two staff members. While the staff member with his hands free helped us with the printer, the staff member still seated berated about how rude we were, seeming to think that we were actually blaming him for the broken printer.

So i think i might be getting stalked and it has been going on [DATE] and i know it's [DATE] but I'm mainly reaching out just in case it continues to happen or it starts happening again [DATE]. So [DATE] semester i would go to the library and this guy started to come in and would walk around the floor and sit in the table right in front of me and would never take out any materials and just stair at me for a few hours and then would get up and leave and he would do the exact same thing every single time i would go to the library. He never got out any materials he would just stair at me. When i would look at him he would look away. So i started switching up the floors i would study on in the library in hopes of him not doing that anymore. But he would always end up finding the floor i was on and it has continued to happen this semester as well. I spend a lot of time in the library and i think i brushed to off because i didn't want to cause a problem if i was just over reacting. When I'm on campus i will run into him and there has been multiple times where he has been standing near where i am and just staring at me and it's really creepy. There was also times where i would move the big white dry erase boards and move them infront of my table so he couldn't stair at me and he would leave and then a few hours later he came back and this time sat at the table directly beside me and would just stair. [DATE] i went to the library and he came on the the exact same floor again walked around and sat in the table again right infront of me and he was staring at me again. t's not even like there is not a bunch of tables he could sit at that would not be near me. After about ## minutes i realize i forgot something and had to go downstairs and i was gone for maybe # minutes and when i got back to the floor i was on he had left. It's just super uncomfortable because he never gets out any work to work on he just sits there and looks at me for long periods of time and maybe it's just a coincidence that he always chooses the same floor as me or always goes during the times i go. But i have seen him at other places just staring at me. I don't know if there could possibly be something wrong with him like developmentally but i just wanted to see exactly what you guys think. Sorry if this is a long stretch but it's been happening way too long for me to not reach out to someone,Harassment / Abuse,1015496,0,0,8,,,,

There are SEVERE thunderstorms happened right now with thunder and lightening. After waiting since #pm with no rain, the senior class advisors decided that ## minutes [ACRONYM] it started pouring rain with thunder and lightening that we were going to leave the orioles game. They gave us a very vague email and even the security guard at the orioles game was confused why we were going to meet the buses at the [ORG] stadium rather than the [GPE] stadium. The email didn't specify where the buses would actually be (just near the side of [ORG] stadium....which is a large stadium). Even the security guard didn't understand the vague email and was unsure of exactly where to tell us to go. The security guard said there was ‚Äúno easy was the get to the stadium‚Ä?and we would have the cross multiple parking lots. Not only did me and my friends have to run across # main roads to get to the bus location, but we had to run across parking lots that were flooded (water soaking our shoes), as well as rain pouring down and thunder and lightening still in the sky. My friends and I not only felt very unsafe with the weather conditions, but we had to cross # main roads because part of the parking lot was closed. When we finally arrived at the bus, one class advisor (I'm unsure of his name....not [PERSON] but another guy who I think works in [ORG] but also with res life? He is tall, brownish hair, glasses) was standing with an umbrella outside the bus. I said ‚Äúthis is safe?‚Ä?because we were soaked, out of breath from trying not to get hit when crossing the roads, and confused by the bus location. Not only was the man [PERSON] [ACRONYM] but he responded in a snippy way saying that he wasn't the one who made us cross the main roads. I told him that he was the one who picked this spot (I was also in contact with [NORP] the class rep who said that this is what the class advisors said to do). He immediately rolled his eyes at me and said ‚Äúoh wow.‚Ä?I have never felt #) so unsafe on a school trip and #) so disrespected by a faculty remember before. I have worked for res life and that is [ACRONYM] how students are supposed to be treated. Coming from a student who is about to enter the workforce, I know that treating people as beneath you only works for so long. My main complaints are the lack of safety concerns taken (I blame the advisors and not the students so please do not blame [PERSON], [PERSON], or another of the other student leaders) and the complete and absolute rude and demeaning response I received from a class advisor.

While we were greeting outside my apartment located on [ORG] street ([ORG] area), two armed men approached my friend and I with their guns and asked for our properties, i.e. phones, wallets. We took the best decision and gave them our wallet and cell phones. I strongly believe that the two men were influenced by drugs, and a tragedy was close to happen; similar to what happened to two [ORG] students on [DATE]. While I am thankful to God, I am totally disappointed with [ORG] regarding its safety measures around the [ORG] area. Specially, it is disappointing that [ORG] decreases the number of its safety staff as we get closer to [DATE]. It will be further disappointing if [ORG] does not decide to locate safety staff at each intersection and corner around the [ORG] area. It is not the first story and will not be the last one you hear from [ORG] students, staff and alumni. To end this tragedy, locate safety staff at each intersection around the [ORG] area [ORG] and show that the safety of [ORG] students, staff and alumni matters to you in reality. We have heard a lot from [ORG]'s executives that the safety of [ORG]'s people are the top priority for the school. Please prove your words by the actions you take.

Staying within my stall, I addressed the man. He did not respond verbally, nor move away, despite clearly acknowledging my presence as he was making eye contact. I ordered the man to get out, and he left. I did not see him on the premises when I exited the bathroom. I did not report this immediately as I had to download and set up the LiveSafe app and did not feel in immediate danger since the man appeared to have left the building. These are the details I recall of his appearance: Probably between #'#"" and #'##"" tall. Light red hair, cut short (close to a buzz cut). Balding, with part of the crown of his head, above his forehead, exposed. Had a light red beard, also trimmed close to his face on the sides but projected slightly out at his jawline. Oval face with some freckles. His eyes appeared gray/blue. As he had exposed much of his body, reddish chest hair could be observed. Wore a checked [GPE] or polo shirt. Had [ORG] pants and a black belt. I do not recall clearly, but I believe he had on a light brown knit beanie, almost [ORG], on the back of his head. He appearedbto be a student based on his dress. I estimate [DATE]. Being familiar with the [ACRONYM] building, graduate students with classes or functions frequent the upper floors most commonly. I regret that I can provide no further information.

[DATE] after that incident, I see him again at the bus, sitting next to a girl and asking her the same questions. Questions like: What's your name?, where are you from?, do you go to school? The girl was responding all these questions, she said she goes to [ORG], he said he used to go there [DATE]. Then he asked if she was going home and where did she live, he asked if she wanted to be friends with him. During this time I was looking at the girl and I was making signs to stop talking to him or giving him information. A girl next to me started to talk to the girl pretending that she knew her, so that the guy could leave her alone. She was definitely very uncomfortable and the guy acted really weird you know there's something wrong with him. He has a noticeable scar in the top of his left eyebrow. This also happened around #:## [ACRONYM] so he probably most times takes the bus that time. I actually just downloaded the app to make this report because I felt I had to say something.

There was a big group of people getting signed into the lobby at around #:##pm, but I was the only person waiting for the elevator and also the only person that got into the elevator, but as the doors were closing a guy ran and jumped in. He walked all the way to the back of the elevator and didn't press any floors in the elevator, so I asked what floor and he looked at the floor I had pressed and said ‚ÄúI'll just go to the eighth floor‚Ä? I had a weird feeling so I didn't go straight to my room once I got out of the elevator and went into the floor's main lounge instead. The guy got out of the elevator after me but didn't go to any of the rooms and just stood outside of the lounge I was in. I was on one side of the lounge for a bit. I then walked to the other side of the lounge and when I did the guy started walking toward the same side from the outside too. When I stopped by the door he also stopped by the door so I turned back and went to sit on the couch instead. He stood by the door for a few more seconds and when I didn't walk out he started to walk down the hall. I stayed in the lounge longer to call my friends because I was freaked out. I didn't see the same guy walk back towards the elevator to leave. He's definately not someone from my floor and I don't think he went into anyone's room so I think he left using the stairs on the other side of the floor. I'm also not sure if he was friends with the group of people that were getting signed in at around #:##pm or if he even got signed in because he didn't enter the elevator with any of the other people, and he ran in to the elevator last minute by himself. There was a big group of people so it was chaotic by where the security was. It was strange that he didn't press any floors in the elevator, and that he also stopped to stand outside the lounge without going anywhere.

Another student, I'll call him ‚ÄúWill‚Ä?in this report, arrived later, after everyone else had been drinking for several hours. I was already drunk at that point. A friend introduced me to Will, then after a short time he and I went for a walk. We kissed during the walk, and that was all. When we arrived back at F most everyone had dispersed to various apartments across campus. I wanted to stop by each apartment to say goodbye to people before the break, and Will followed me around to each apartment. I didn't think much of it at the time. After leaving the last apartment, Will offered for me to come to his apartment in [GPE] J to get high, and I agreed. We went to his room and talked as the drug hit us. We began kissing again, but as we were kissing the effects of the weed were becoming increasingly stronger. This effect, layered on top of being very drunk and sleep deprived, pulled me into a barely conscious state where I was not able to communicate verbally, though I thought clearly about what I wanted to say. Will continued, getting me to help him take my clothes off. I remember that he consistently asked if each step was okay, though all I could do to communicate was nod. Steps he asked about included removing my clothes, fondling my boobs and vaginal area, fingering my vagina, and penetrating my vagina with his penis. The nods did not align with my thoughts, however, which were along the lines of ‚Äúno, I don't want to do this.‚Ä?I wanted to be able to communicate that message so badly, but I could not get my body to cooperate. Because of the sleep deprivation and drugs combination, I fell asleep during the act of penetration. I was going in and out of consciousness for some time while the act was happening, more terrified each time I woke up. I don't remember a lot of what happened during the time I was at his apartment. At one point, I do remember Will saying ‚ÄúDo you usually have sex for three hours?‚Ä?implying the act had been occurring for that amount of time. That sentence terrified me because it had only felt like I'd been awake for around ## minutes. I remember finally being able to get up and dress myself. Will insisted that I stay until morning, but I went back to my apartment. I arrived back to my apartment in F around # am. I slept for about # hours, then had to get up and pack to leave for break. I was in a great deal of pain that morning, and likely would have gotten a rape kit done had my family not been expecting me at home.

He has repeatedly tried to flirt with both of us on different occasions. [DATE], he came from the [ORG] into the [ORG]'s sitting area and sat down with my friend and I and gave us free cake from the loop. Last night, my friend and I were eating [ORG]'s at ##:## am or so, when he came up to us (uninvited) (and we clearly did not look like we wanted his company). He proceeded to lean on the booth next to my friend and begin a conversion. He bragged about his multiple jobs and his charity work with young kids. He then proceeded to turn to my friend and say ‚Äúscoot over‚Ä? We stared at him in silence for like ## seconds, shocked at his inappropriate demand. He then demanded a second time, saying ‚Äúscoot!‚Ä?in a very demeaning way. She moved over and he jumped in the both (despite the fact that we both were not acknowledging him with words or eye contact) and proceeded to put his arm around her. She was clearly uncomfortable and she scooted as far from him as she could. He proceeded to try and make conversion with me (ignoring my friend and how uncomfortable she was) and stared straight at me very intensely even when I didn't respond to his statements. He then told us he was on his was to drop off deposits, but that he say us and just had to come hang out. It was a very uncomfortable situation, we were both clearly uncomfortable yet he kept invading our space. He has some power because he practically runs the campus hotspot for eating. So we couldn't blatantly reject him or tell him to leave us alone without disrupting our [DATE] routines (which involves going to the loop and [PERSON] center and seeing him). I made an excuse to leave and we rushed off, he stared at me as if he was interrogating me. It was so weird. I feel uncomfortable and do not know how to stop his advances without making things even more uncomfortable. I don't want him to know that it was me and my friend that are telling on him because he knows us and could easily retaliate or find us (he knows we live on campus). I'm not saying that he would do anything explicitly violent or stalkerish, but you can never know or be too careful.

I tell him where to go and he asks if I could walk with him. I said no because I have a class. He then proceeds to ask where my class is, compliments me a lot, basically, a lot of conversational stuff that [PERSON] and [PERSON], and info that he doesn't need to know from someone he simply asked directions from. He then asked for my phone number and my [NORP], and I eventually just came up with the excuse that I wasn't a social person and walked away, since things felt way too off. Later on, I walk out of my last class in the journalism building (a three hour class) and I saw the guy again across the street in front of the psychology building, talking to a young girl that looked like a freshman. I only saw him from behind, so I'm not sure if it was absolutely him, but something gave me a gut feeling to walk the complete opposite way where he couldn't see me, and that's exactly what I did. It just gave me the vibe that he possibly tried to follow me to where my building/classes were from earlier, but eventually got distracted by talking to someone else. He could've been there for hours and I might not have known. Or went somewhere else, and came right back. The guy was a very dark [NORP] man, with a black collar shirt and black shorts, and black shoes and a black backpack I believe. He also had what sounded like an [NORP] accent that was very distinct. He looked like he was a lot older too, maybe ##+. He seemed about #'#-#'##ish. I'm #'#, so he was pretty much at my eye level. I also highly suspect that he's not even a student here, based off of the strange directions he asked for (he asked where the Ramesses [ACRONYM] Statue was). Perhaps this could've been the case of a completely innocent guy who just wanted to know directions and wanted to get to know me in the process. But, something felt off, and I'm just worried for younger girls who are more na√Øve than me. For someone who simply asked for directions, he seemed way too forward in a creepy way, and I just suspect that he's trying to prey on young girls that go here, and could possibly hurt them or kidnap them or something. I would just want to be cautious.",Suspicious Activity,2046189,0,0,4,,,,

However, I can promise this is still relevant. My concern is about sporting events at [ORG] field. As an underage student I expect a safe and alcohol free environment when I sit in the student section. At the game against [GPE] everyone around me was absolutely wasted. The men behind be were falling on me, hitting me, throwing stuff at me, cursing at me and spitting on me. I consider this to be a very unsafe environment for myself. One of the men actually pushed someone down the bleachers and onto my friends. It was so crowded and I couldn't move and I didn't know what to do. I watched so many students bring in whiskey. One girl in particular had little plastic shooters all the way around her waist in her pants and then pulled even more out from in between her boobs. She was definitely not the only one. Everywhere I looked people had whiskey. After the game was over I saw that the men behind me had left behind an empty fifth in the bleachers. I know that the school must have knowledge of all the alcohol that is consumed by minors on [DATE] because someone has to clean the stadium. I know it's not a secret. My question is, why are they allowed in the game? I understand that they are sneaking it in but they were also already very far gone when they got there. They shouldn't have been let inside and they definitely should have been given a breath test. I shouldn't have to worry about being harassed by drunks when sitting in the student section. Yes I know that it is impossible to keep students from drinking. Yes I know that the university can't be held responsible for the actions of the students that attend the games. However, I do consider it the responsibility of those in charge to keep drunk students (especially underage students) from entering the stadium as well as sneaking in alcohol. I don't have a solution to this issue, but I definitely feel something needs to be done. I was violated and harassed and that is unacceptable.",Drugs/Alcohol,2050248,1,0,4,,,,

I didn't immediately see an issue with this and tried to talk to the young man, but he didn't seem to have much interest in conversation. He began grabbing me, my butt, and chest, in ways that I felt uncomfortable with. In an effort to remove myself from the scary situation, I tried to walk away, but he didn't let me. He pulled me back in, violently, by my belt loops on my bottoms. He proceeded to put his hands down the waistband of my bottoms and grope me under my clothing in ways I felt very uncomfortable with, and ways that will be stained into my memories forever. I remember looking around, looking for a way out, and seeing several members of the baseball team watching what was happening and laughing at me; as I probably looked about as helpless as I felt. I kept trying to pull away, and he again didn't allow me to and pulled me back in by my belt loops. I eventually broke free from the situation and went back to campus.

I am emailing you because I am concerned for my safety here. [DATE], around #:## [ACRONYM] my roommate and I were up talking with the lights off while laying in bed. While I was laying in bed, I looked out of the window and saw a bright light flashing on and off. At first, I thought it was my roommates phone, but when I asked her to turn it off, the light was still there. After that, I told her that I thought there was someone outside of our window, because it was the only thing that made sense, since our window is facing the [ORG] building and there lights were off. I proceeded to look outside the window, but didn't see anything because it was too dark. After I looked outside the window, my roommate looked, and she did indeed see someone sitting right below our window. She said she saw someone with a phone and something else shiny and circular in his hands. My roommate tried to take a picture, but suspected that the guy thought we saw him, so he turned off his phone screen. When she looked again, she said he saw her, smiled, and then waved at her. We were immediately concerned and told our [ORG]. After we told her we came back into our room, and my roommate looked outside the window again and said he was gone. After, we told one of our friends and asked him to check it out, to see if the guy was still there. He went out side, while we were at the exit door watching and recording him. Our friend, found that a man was still under our window. He said that after he called out to see if anyone was there a second time, the man came out and said he was there. The man said he was just sitting there smoking because he didn't want to go anywhere else and be caught. Unfortunately my friend does not have great eyesight and was not wearing his glasses to see if he was actually smoking. Our friend was coming back in to tell us what happened, but I asked him to go back and tell the man to move from under our window and go to a different spot. My friend said that the man also said that he lived on the third floor of this side of [ORG]. I don't believe this to be true because, after my friend came back inside, my roommate, our friend, our friend's roommate, and I were sitting in the hallway on the first floor, talking about the situation, tay, tay's roommate and I saw him pass the exit door, about ##-## minutes later. This means that he waited ##-## minutes later to move from the spot he was in, after my friend asked him to leave. Also, [DATE] after that the man did not walk in to this side of [ORG], because my friends and I would of saw him, since we were in the hallway of the first floor. This also means that he was lying about where he lives. After my roommate and I finish talking in the hallway with our friends, we went into our room, locked the door, locked our window, and out a sheet over our blinds. My roommate and I were talking in our room and, she said that it looked like the man was a young white male, around our age. She got the best look at him. Even though we covered the blinds and locked our window, I still don't feel safe in my room at night after the situation. One reason is because, now I feel that I can't sleep with the window open, or even have it open for long periods of time, while I am by myself in the room, from fear that someone will cut through the screen and come in. Another reason is because the sheet that we have up, only covers about ##% of the window. My bed is against the window and a small portion isn't covered by the sheet, so now sometimes I feel that anyone can come to our window and look through the areas that are not covered. My last reason is that now I am almost afraid to look out of the window, from fear that someone might be looking back at me, or when I do, I still feel that someone might still be there, because I didn't even see the man outside my roommates and my window [DATE] morning. Unfortunately, I don't feel secure in my own room. It takes me a bit longer to fall asleep, which leaves me tired during [DATE], and I feel paranoid, when I am alone, compared to the times before this situation, were I felt safe, and I could fall asleep with no problem, or even stay up, purely because I want/need to, and not out. of paranoia or fear. I know [DATE] have passed, and my roommate and I haven't reported it, but that was because I was trying to ""be brave"", but after talking with my parents, I see that I can still ""be brave"", while also being cautious and safe. So I am emailing you this becauseI don't know what else to do or if anything can be done, but I wanted you to know about the situation.

We all believe he was under the influence of drugs, and his name is [ORG]. We fired him and asked him to leave but he refused to leave multiple times and asked to speak with our faculty supervisors. His dad also called in and yelled at us for how we treated his son, but the account of the situation he gave us was distorted and false. There were two meetings with faculty to explain to him the situation but he was still very resistant, almost to the point of being delusional. Many people at [DATE] [GPE] can attest to how concerning his behavior was. Fast forward to [DATE]. I was waiting outside of my [NORP] professor's office for her office hours, and when the door opened, he came out with her and they were still speaking from their meeting. I heard him ask her for the dean of the language department's contact information, and she calmly said she would get it over to him. He then stalked away and aggressively called her ‚Äúuseless‚Ä?in front of me and another student. When I went my professor's office, I immediately told her about how he behaved at [DATE] [GPE]. She thanked me for telling her because she said his behavior was unsettling/disturbing; apparently he's not even in one of her classes, he just came to her with an issue because she is the head of the [NORP] department, so she had never met him before. I told her about how we all at [DATE] [GPE] had thought he was on drugs, and she agreed and said ‚Äúhe had mentioned some of that to me.‚Ä?She did not reveal too much about the meeting as it would've been inappropriate, but we both agreed something had to be done. She even said she had to take a few moments to compose herself after the meeting because of how much it affected her. I told her he seemed like the school shooter type - something I originally thought when he was in the [DATE] [GPE] office - and all of my fellow [GPE] staff members as well as the professor agreed. She then approached me next class and asked if I had the LiveSafe app and whether reporting here would be a good option. We didn't talk any further on it as class started but I figure I should go ahead and report this. I'm saying all of this to set up the fact that I'm actually really scared of what he might do if something sets him off. For [DATE] after the [DATE] [GPE] incident I was on guard for if he maybe walked into the newsroom in some form of retaliation against the fact that we refused to re-hire him. And I don't want to stereotype or label him as a school shooter immediately - I struggle with mental health issues myself, and I don't want to discount the fact that that I do not know the full extent of his situation and cannot make immediate judgments. I'm just saying I'm concerned and would hate myself if I didn't speak up and something happened. Y'all can contact me back if you have any other questions; I'm sure my friends at [GPE] who were present would be willing to back up what I've said, as well as the professor I mentioned.",Suspicious Activity,2084462,0,0,13,,,,

They were friends with this guy I had recently met the previous night, [PERSON], who is a football player on [ORG] team (###). [PERSON] and his friends, [ACRONYM] [PERSON], and [PERSON] do not attend [ORG]. [PERSON], [ACRONYM] and possibly [PERSON] attend [ORG] while [PERSON], I am almost positive, attends [ORG]. Originally, I did not want these boys to spend the night in my apartment but felt bad because they didn't have a place to stay. With that being said, I opened up my apartment to them and they spent the night. I will embarrassingly admit that they were unattended for short periods of time. Once I woke up in the morning, I only saw two out of the four guys. I also woke up to [PERSON] dropping his phone by my bed. On the floor where he dropped his phone, there was a twenty dollar bill. I asked [PERSON] and [PERSON] when they were leaving and both said, ‚ÄúI don't know‚Ä?but [PERSON] proceeded to tell me that he had to make a phone call then shut my bedroom door. I then heard my main door to the apartment close. I sat up on my bed for a minute then realized that [PERSON]'s backpack was no longer in my room. I jumped out of my bed to see what was going on. When I looked into my living room/kitchen area, it looked like nobody was ever there. I then went back into my room to call [PERSON] but our messages on my phone were deleted. He deleted them the night previous when he told me he had to ‚Äúcall his mom.‚Ä?(I don't know why I believed him.) Luckily, he didn't delete my recent calls so I texted him. After I texted him I raided my room to see what other items the boys stole from me. In the morning, all I could figure out was missing were my [ORG] and $##. Later on [DATE], I realized that they also stole one of my phone charging blocks and a lighter for my candles. I went on to text [PERSON] giving him and his friends one last chance to speak the truth. Nobody confessed anything. Additionally, the [DATE] night just days before, [ACRONYM] stole $## from one of my friend's purse. I am willing to talk more in detail about this story.

I found this odd and knew he was nervous about something, and thought maybe he wanted to steal my AirPods I was wearing. We reached the first floor of the library and I walked slow and waiting for him to go out before me. When I was outside I saw he had turned left, which was the opposite of where I was going (which was to the right around the corner of the building). However, I still felt unsafe so I kept looking over my shoulders as I walked up the block. That's when I saw him come around the corner and walk in my direction. You could tell he wasn't expecting me to see him, and he hesitated to continue but then proceeded to walk up towards me. I stopped and started acting like I was waiting for someone. He then passed me and continued to walk up the block. I decided to walk back into the library for me to get my keys out my bag which have a pepper spray attached and get a hold of someone to talk too on the phone as I walked to my car. When I finally was on the phone with pepper spray in hand I walked back out and when I turned the corner the man was returning back down the block toward the library again. He looked at me, and I think he may have noticed I had my pepper spray in my hand and passed me once again. This time I speed walked up the block, consistently looking over my shoulder, and turned left at the corner and got into my car. This incident really scared me; I'm not sure if I am over paranoid.

My house is located on Mabel street across the street on the west from [LOC] and directly across the street on the south from [ORG] owned houses, some which serve as offices and some which appear empty. I witnessed a [PERSON] and # men all of whom were outside of the vehicle with at least one of them loading something on wheels into the back of the [PERSON]. In the dark and from afar it looked like luggage. Neither them nor I said anything, but I walked maybe [QUANTITY] away from them and walked west. My initial reaction was that it was a neighbor getting picked up by a friend to be taken to the airport (friend because there was evidence of those light up signs from [FAC] or Lyft cars), however, I am very familiar with the gentlemen who live on the other rental property that my house shares a driveway with, and either one of them would have said hello. Additionally all of the neighbors whom I have met or casually seen from afar from the houses surrounding ours happen to be women, and there was plenty of street parking available in from of the other houses. I walked away and changed my path to appear as if I was walking toward [LOC] and the [PERSON] drove away before I got halfway down the length of [LOC] apartment building. The [PERSON] drove south down [GPE] and I believe turned east unto [PERSON]. Once the [PERSON] was out of sight, Iimmediately turned back toward my house and noticed a glove (pictured) on the street where they would have been loading the [PERSON]. I entered my house and texted one of my neighbors, and he confirmed it was neither him nor his male roommate who was associated with the [PERSON]. After waiting a few minutes, I exited my house again and confirmed the two cars belonging to our house were locked and that there was no evidence of break-in in the # cars in the driveway (all belonging to us tenants from the two rental properties that share one driveway). I took a picture of the glove which I left on the ground and retrieved a luggage sticker, also pictured, which I kept. The concern is that the unknown persons coordinating to load things at weird hours is suspicious, specially given the presence of the glove. The luggage could be used as a tool to transport and hide items and the glove could be used to hide prints. There is also a concern that because there was no apparent evidence of larceny against our personal property, that perhaps one of the university properties right across the street was the target. The luggage wheels make transport easier and parking across the street reduced the chances that the [PERSON] might be caught on security footage if the university properties are equiped with safety cameras. I have tried to clearly delinate the facts that I observed, from my speculation. But I thought indicating why things seems suspicious and out of place to an observer might help provide context, and help explain why I believe the university might want to investigate as opposed to this solely involving personal non-university property, which might be juriduction of [ORG].",Suspicious Activity,2212316,0,0,4,,,,
