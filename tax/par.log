 Answer:
Yes

 Explanation:
",

No

 Explanation:

Based on the given information, it is not consistent to add "driving" as a child of "sailing" because it does not align with the parent of the parent node, "water_travel". "Sailing" and "driving" are both forms of travel, but they use different modes of transportation (water and land, respectively).
