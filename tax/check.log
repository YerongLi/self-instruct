    - Question:
"blood_sport" represents the child node term under consideration. 
 - "blood_sport" : sport that involves killing animals (especially hunting)
"blood_sport" has children of "hunt", "bullfighting" and "cockfighting".
 - "hunt" : the pursuit and killing or capture of wild animals regarded as a sport
 - "bullfighting" : the activity at a bullfight
 - "cockfighting" : participation in the sport of matching gamecocks in a cockfight
Now we want to add "blood_sport" as a new child to the term "sport".
 - "sport" : an active diversion requiring physical exertion and competition
If we decide to add a new node "blood_sport" as a child of "sport", it should conceptually become the consistent grandchild of "hunt", "bullfighting" a
nd "cockfighting".

 Answer:
Yes
 Explanation:
hunt: Originally a child of "blood_sport," it will now be a grandchild of "sport" in the expanded hierarchy. This is because "blood_sport" is becoming a child of "sport," making "hunt" a consistent grandchild.

bullfighting: Similar to "hunt," "bullfighting" was a direct child of "blood_sport" and will now be a consistent grandchild of "sport" after the addition of "blood_sport" as a child of "sport."

cockfighting: In the same manner, "cockfighting" was a child of "blood_sport" and will become a consistent grandchild of "sport" once "blood_sport" is added as a child of "sport."

In summary, the addition of "blood_sport" as a child to the term "sport" ensures that its existing children ("hunt," "bullfighting," and "cockfighting") consistently become grandchildren of the newly designated parent term "sport."

    - Question:
"police_work" represents the child node term under consideration. 
 - "police_work" : the investigation of criminal activities
"police_work" has children of "forensics", "surveillance" and "roundup".
 - "forensics" : scientific tests or techniques used in the investigation of crimes
 - "surveillance" : close observation of a person or group (usually by the police)
 - "roundup" : the systematic gathering up of suspects by the police
Now we want to add "police_work" as a new child to the term "activity".
 - "activity" : any specific behavior
If we decide to add a new node "police_work" as a child of "activity", it should conceptually become the consistent grandchild of "forensics", "surveillance" and "roundup".
