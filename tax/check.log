    - Question:
"detonation" represents the child node term under consideration. 
 - "detonation" : the act of detonating an explosive
['"percussion"'] is the subclass of "percussion".
 - "percussion" : the act of exploding a percussion cap
Now we want to add "detonation" as a new child to the term "explosion".
 - "explosion" : the act of exploding or bursting
If we decide to add a new node "detonation" as a child of "explosion", it should conceptually become the consistent grandchild of "percussion".

 Answer:
